abstract = {Determining the optimal well location in a reservoir is a challenging problem. It involves taking several factors into account, including geological uncertainty, reservoir and fluid properties, economic costs, and technical ability. Most research on well placement optimization under uncertainty has assumed static uncertainty in the reservoir parameters, until the introduction of the pseudohistory concept. The pseudohistory concept incorporates the field's probable history and results in the determination of optimal locations of future wells with greater certainty. This approach, however, requires an excessive number of simulations and may not be practical for optimization of a reservoir model having a large number of geological realizations. In this study, we use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to perform history matching of the PUNQ-S3 reservoir model using data from six production wells over an eight-year period. This is followed by well placement optimization using a genetic algorithm (GA) combined with pseudohistory matching, carried out over two years, following the placement of the first future well. Thus, this approach not only provides increased certainty in optimal well placement but also, using EnKF as a history matching method, requires only a single “best estimate” realization for objective function evaluation during GA optimization. As a result, the total time taken to find the optimal well locations is significantly reduced. We illustrate this through comparison with the previous research.},

abstract = {Well placement within a reservoir is a challenging step in the reservoir development process. Determining the optimal well location is a complex problem involving many factors including geological uncertainty, reservoir and fluid properties, economic costs, and technical ability. Often, broad possibilities and constraints on computational resources limit the scenarios that can be considered. The use of engineering judgment to solve this complex and nonlinear problem may not be sufficient. The use of automatic well placement optimization as an aiding tool has recently gained interest in the petroleum industry and in academia. This paper surveys the literature dealing with well placement optimization. The areas considered include: optimization algorithm, reservoir response model, approach to handle uncertainty, and a special section on well placement optimization in gas/gas-condensate fields. Major drawbacks of current methods and areas of possible future work are identified.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparison study in which several partners have applied methods to quantify uncertainty on production forecasts for reservoir models conditioned to both static and dynamic well data. A synthetic case study was set up, based on a real field case. All partners received well porosity/permeability data and historic' production data. Noise was added to both data types. A geological description was given to guide the parameterization of the reservoir model. Partners were asked to condition their reservoir models to these data and estimate the probability distribution of total field production at the end of the forecast period. The various approaches taken by the partners were categorized. Results showed that for a significant number of approaches the truth case was outside the predicted range. The choice of parameterization and initial reservoir models gave the largest influence on the prediction range, whereas the choice of reservoir simulator introduced a bias in the predicted range.},

Population individuals called country are in two types: colonies and imperialists that all together form some empires. Imperialistic competition among these empires forms the basis of the proposed evolutionary algorithm. During this competition, weak empires collapse and powerful ones take possession of their colonies. Imperialistic competition hopefully converges to a state in which there exist only one empire and its colonies are in the same position and have the same cost as the imperialist. Applying the proposed algorithm to some of benchmark cost functions, shows its ability in dealing with different types of optimization problems.},

@inproceedings{Emerick2009,
abstract = {Abstract Well placement optimization is a very challenging problem due to the large number of decision variables involved and the nonlinearity of the reservoir response as well as of the well placement constraints. Over the years, a lot of research has been done on this problem, most of which using optimization routines coupled to reservoir simulation models. Despite all this research, there is still a lack of robust computer-aided optimization tools ready to be applied by asset teams in real field development projects. This paper describes the implementation of a tool, based on a Genetic Algorithm, for the simultaneous optimization of number, location and trajectory of producer and injector wells. The developed software is the result of a two-year project focused on a robust implementation of a computer-aided optimization tool to deal with realistic well placement problems with arbitrary well trajectories, complex model grids and linear and nonlinear constraints. The developed optimization tool uses a commercial reservoir simulator as the evaluation function without using proxies to substitute the full numerical model. Due to the large size of the problem, in some cases involving more than 100 decision variables, the optimization process may require thousands of reservoir simulations. Such a task has become feasible through a distributed computing environment running multiple simulations at the same time. The implementation uses a technique called Genocop III{\"{i}}¿½{\^{a}}€{\oe} Genetic Algorithm for Numerical Optimization of Constrained Problems {\"{i}}¿½{\^{a}}€{\oe} to deal with well placement constraints. Such constraints include grid size, maximum length of wells, minimum distance between wells, inactive grid cells and user-defined regions of the model, with non-uniform shape, where the optimization routine is not supposed to place wells. The optimization process was applied to three full-field reservoir models based on real cases. It increased the net present values and the oil recovery factors obtained by well placement scenarios previously proposed by reservoir engineers. The process was also applied to a synthetic case, based on outcrop data, to analyze the impact of using reservoir quality maps to generate an initial well placement scenario for the optimization routine without using an engineer-defined configuration.{\^{A}} Introduction The definition of a well placement is a key aspect with major impact in a field development project. In this sense, the use of reservoir simulation allows the engineer to evaluate different placement scenarios. However, the current industry practice is still, in most cases, a manual procedure of trial and error that requires a lot of experience and knowledge from the engineers involved in the project. Considering that, the development of well placement optimization tools which can automate this process is a high desirable goal.},
