Disclaimer The data series for proved oil and gas reserves in BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2017 does not necessarily meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance, as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, nor does it necessarily represent BP's view of proved reserves by country. Rather, the data series has been compiled using a combination of primary official sources and third-party data.},

@article{Lyons2013,
abstract = {Determining the optimal well location in a reservoir is a challenging problem. It involves taking several factors into account, including geological uncertainty, reservoir and fluid properties, economic costs, and technical ability. Most research on well placement optimization under uncertainty has assumed static uncertainty in the reservoir parameters, until the introduction of the pseudohistory concept. The pseudohistory concept incorporates the field's probable history and results in the determination of optimal locations of future wells with greater certainty. This approach, however, requires an excessive number of simulations and may not be practical for optimization of a reservoir model having a large number of geological realizations. In this study, we use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to perform history matching of the PUNQ-S3 reservoir model using data from six production wells over an eight-year period. This is followed by well placement optimization using a genetic algorithm (GA) combined with pseudohistory matching, carried out over two years, following the placement of the first future well. Thus, this approach not only provides increased certainty in optimal well placement but also, using EnKF as a history matching method, requires only a single “best estimate” realization for objective function evaluation during GA optimization. As a result, the total time taken to find the optimal well locations is significantly reduced. We illustrate this through comparison with the previous research.},

abstract = {Well placement within a reservoir is a challenging step in the reservoir development process. Determining the optimal well location is a complex problem involving many factors including geological uncertainty, reservoir and fluid properties, economic costs, and technical ability. Often, broad possibilities and constraints on computational resources limit the scenarios that can be considered. The use of engineering judgment to solve this complex and nonlinear problem may not be sufficient. The use of automatic well placement optimization as an aiding tool has recently gained interest in the petroleum industry and in academia. This paper surveys the literature dealing with well placement optimization. The areas considered include: optimization algorithm, reservoir response model, approach to handle uncertainty, and a special section on well placement optimization in gas/gas-condensate fields. Major drawbacks of current methods and areas of possible future work are identified.},
